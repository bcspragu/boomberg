# Boomberg

Boomberg is my [SvelteHack 2024](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/2024) entry (an attempt at "Wizzbangery Wizard"). It's also my 2024 attempt at a Christmas game for my friends, a tradition I've done (almost) every year for the past decade or so.

Boomberg is a stonk simulator. You are a trader at the BADSAQ exchange, you'll use your Boomberg terminal to make trades, take out highly leveraged loans from questionable sources, spread disinformation, and pay insiders for tips.

This project currently doesn't exist, because I haven't built any of it yet, but that's generally the next step after creating a blank Svelte 5 repo.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`, then start a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.


## TODO

- [ ] Install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters), probably for Node.
- [ ] Build everything
